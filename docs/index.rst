Welcome to the **Unstable Baselines** docs!
===================================

`Unstable Baselines <https://github.com/LeonGuertler/UnstableBaselines>`\_ is an Async, Online, Multi-Turn, Multi-Agent RL library for training reasoning models on `TextArena <https://github.com/LeonGuertler/TextArena>`\_ games.

What is Unstable Baselines?
-----------------------

**Unstable Baselines** is a lightweight reinforcement-learning research harness focused on *self-play* for text-based games. It couples:

* **Ray** - easy, elastic distributed execution.
* **vLLM** - high-throughput inference with LoRA hot-swapping.
* **TextArena** - a growing suite of competitive text games.

The goal is to iterate **quickly** on small language models (< 8B params) and benchmark new ideas in *reasoning and agentic behaviour*.
Since multiple recent papers showed the sufficiency of LoRA for reasoning tuning, and the fact that opponent sampling for self-play strategies beyond mirror self-play work best when using LoRA weights (since vLLM allows for hot-swapping), we built UnstableBaselines as a LoRA first RL library. 
We tried to keep the code as straight forward as possible. It is currently around **1.2K** lines long and semi-readable.
